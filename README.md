# bundl

bundle is a resource management tool that makes it easier to collect and access related information. Store your favorite sites, articles, videos and other media in organized 'bundls". Access saved information across the Internet from one location and never lose valueable online resources!

## Development
bundl is a web application written in Ruby on Rails with a bootstrap + jquery front-end component. The app uses the `rspec-rails` gem to integrate RSpec behavior driven development.

## Usage
Bundl is a bookmarking app that allows you to store related online resources in organized collections. The home page displays a card deck of all the existing bundls and allows for bundl management. Each time the page loads, every bundl is assigned an image. The image is generated by querying the Unsplash API (https://unsplash.com/developers) with the bundl title and randomly selecting an image from the returned result set. Click on a bundl title to enter the collection and view the list of contained media items. From here, manage media items and click on a media item title to redirect to the URL of the desired resource.
